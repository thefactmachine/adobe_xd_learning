## Creating and importing

### Using an eclipse with bezier points
Create a circle.  Double click on the circle to get the bezier points.   

* You can add new points by clicking on the radius.
* You can move the bezier points.
* You can double click the bezier point to change it from a curve point to a sharp angle. 

### Intersecting / union and differece
Just select the two shapes and then press the relevant button.  After you have pressed the button...you can press a different button to get subtraction / union / ...etc.

Using **boolean functions** you dont loose data because you can move / resize the first or second shape to get the effect that you want.

### Text Enhancements. 

You can change from a point text to area text just by clicking the button on the right hand side.

### Layers Panel
This is the icon on the lower left.  Just press this and then select an object on the screen.  You will then get a list of objects displayed.  These can be moved up or down as per your preference.

Various layers can be locked or be made invisible.

### Creative Cloud Libraries.
You just go, file open Creative Cloud libraries and then put in your stuff.

Using creative cloud libraries, you can edit an image in Photoshop and then save it and it will be refreshed using Adobe XD.  You can break the link and embed it by pressing the green button on the top right.

Can also store color pallettes in Creative Cloud.

## Layout
Select the artboard, then select the layout check box.  You can choose columns or grid. With columns, you can choose a certain amount of padding (top, right, bottom, left) to surround the columns.   When you change the width of the layout the columns will adjust. 


## Assets
You can use the colour picket to pick from anywhere -- even another application.

You can then add the colour when using the color picker by pressing the "+" button. 

### The Assets Panel
This gets opened up by pressing the two circles (linked by a line) on the bottom left.   

#### Assigning a color *to* the Assets Panel
Just select the object, that contains a specific colour and then click the "+" button on the Assets panel.
 
#### Assigning a color *from* the Assets Panel
Select the object and then select the colour from the assets panel.

#### Editing the colour (global colours)
Just right click the colour in the assets panel.

### Creating and using symbols
Just select the text and then press the "+" button in assets.  You can add Illustrator assets as symbols.

A green outline (when the object is selected) indicates a symbol.

You drag symbols from the Assets Panel into an artboard.

You can copy and paste (in place) symbols from one artboard to another.

To edit the symbol...double click and then say change the font color and it will be updated for all symbols. 

If you dont want a symbol to not be a symbol anymore...then select it > right click and "ungroup" it.

### Character Styles
The font / font weight / size / leading / tracking / color / transparency can also be saved as a character style. 

## Prototyping
You can press the live preview button (to the left of the play button) and if you have a mobile phone connected...then you can live preview. 

You can even download the app directly onto your mobile phone and then you can take this and show people without needing a web connection.

You can save all arboards to Creative Cloud. You can then display it on your mobile app.

Click top / far right icon > publish design specs. This publishes all artboards to a web page.  This web page has the sizes for everything and has what colours were used and where they were used. You can see the positioning of all graphics in pixels.
