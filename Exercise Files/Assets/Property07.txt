Perched on the 16th floor, this one bed one bath with balcony enjoys all-day light, protected River views and is the undoubtedly best renovation ever to be completed in the East River Cooperative. The kitchen has been crafted with custom wooden cabinetry, granite countertops which include a dining table and stainless steel Viking appliances.
