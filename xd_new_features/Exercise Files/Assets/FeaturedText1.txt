Located about ten miles southwest of Cairo, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built as a burial site for Egyptian pharaoh Khufu in the 26th century BCE. Amazingly, the Great Pyramid has withstood the test of time, standing for over 4,500 years; it is the only Ancient Wonder to have survived to the present.
